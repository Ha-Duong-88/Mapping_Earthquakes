# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using JSON data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquake data. 

## Scope 
The scope of the project was to create maps, add earthquake data to the maps, and customizing and stylizing the maps with circles to denote the size of the earthquake magnitugue, popups to display information, various attributes (or features and properties) and tile layer styles.

## Approach
The approach used was to:
    1) Using GeoJSON data, retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and adding the data to a map.
    2) Using Mapbox API and LeafLet library to plot the data on a Mapbox mqp through an API request and create custom, interactive geographical map.
    3) Using JavaScript code an D3.js to library, write code to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
    
# Purpose of the Repository

This repository contains all the project branches created for different styles of maps using Leaflet library and Mapbox API. The Mapbox styles included: maps with circle markers, maps with points, maps with LineStrings, and polygons from GeoJSON data, adding earthquake data to the maps with data and adding different styles for the maps. Users can reference and use the maps in the branches to learn how to create simple to complex GeoJSON maps.

# Results
The following are various views of the earthquake maps for the past 7 days. At the upper corner, there is a popup to select different map views - all earthquakes, tectonic plates, major earthquakes.
