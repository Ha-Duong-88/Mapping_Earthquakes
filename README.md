# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Draft
# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using JSON data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquake data. 


## Scope & Approach
The scope of the project was to create maps, add earthquake data to the maps, and customizing and stylizing the maps with circles to denote the size of the earthquake magnitugue, popups to display information, various attributes (or features and properties) and tile layer styles.

The approach used was to:
    1) Using GeoJSON data, retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and adding the data to a map.
    2) Using Mapbox API and LeafLet library to plot the data on a Mapbox mqp through an API request and create custom, interactive geographical map.
    3) Using JavaScript code an D3.js to library, write code to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
    
  
Using the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
    
## Purpose of the Repository

A README.md that describes the purpose of the repository. Although there is no graded written analysis for this challenge, it is encouraged and good practice to add a brief description of your project.

## Approach
The app JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve  You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps. Mapbox API was used to create custom maps for websites and applications.
