# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Draft
# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using JSON data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquake data.

## Scope & Approach
The project scope involved:
    1) Using GeoJSON data, retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and adding the data to a map.
    2) Using Mapbox API and LeafLet tile layers. Mapbox API was used to create custom map.
    3) Writing JavaScript and D3.js to library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
    4) Using the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map thorugh an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
    
    to create the map, add data to the map, and customizing and stylizing the map with markers, popups, 

## Approach
The app JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve  You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps. Mapbox API was used to create custom maps for websites and applications.
