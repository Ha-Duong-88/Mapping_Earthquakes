# Mapping_Earthquakes
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet library, and Mapbox API.

# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using JSON data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquake data. 

## Scope 
The scope of the project was to create maps, add earthquake data to the maps, and customizing and stylizing the maps with circles, markers, and linestrings to denote the earthquake locations, various attributes (or features and properties) such as color, radius size based on earthquake magnitude, popups to display the data, and tile layer styles.

## Approach
This project involved:

    1) Using JSON and GeoJSON data, retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and adding the data to a map.
    2) Using Mapbox API and LeafLet library to plot the data on a Mapbox mqp through an API request and create custom, interactive geographical map.
    3) Writing JavaScript code an D3.js to library, write code to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
    4) Using CSS to style the hmtl.
    
# Purpose of the Repository

This repository contains all the project branches created for different styles of maps using Leaflet library and Mapbox API. The examples of include: maps with circle markers, maps with points, maps with linestrings, polygons from GeoJSON data, adding earthquake data to the maps with data and adding different styles for the maps. Anyone interested in creating geographical maps can reference and use the maps in the branches to learn how to create simple to complex GeoJSON maps using Leaflet and Mapbox API. The entire repository can serve as starter code creating maps.

Some examples include: 

    1) Simple Leaflet Map
    2) Maps with single and multiple points
    3) Maps with lines
    4) Maps with GeoJSON data displaying polygons and linestrings
    5) Using Layer Groups and Layers Control to add data as an overlay to the map and "laid over" all the base layers and are  visible allthe time
    6) Importing GeoJSON data from JSON data file and URLs
    7) Adding functionality to markers
    8) Using different Mapbox styles API
    


# Results
The following are various views of the earthquake maps for the past 7 days. At the upper corner, there is a popup to select different base layers or tile layers and overlays based on the Map box styles and earthquake data - all earthquakes, tectonic plates, major earthquakes.
