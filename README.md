# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Draft
# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Scope:
The scope of this project involved:
    1) Using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website, retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven   
      days, then adding the data to a map.
    2) Creating a config.js file, which will hold our Mapbox API key.
    3) Creating a logic.js file, which will contain all the JavaScript and Leaflet code to create the map and add data to the map.

## Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps. Mapbox API was used to create custom maps for websites and applications.
